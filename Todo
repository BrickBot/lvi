Todo:
X = fully done; x = partially done
General:
      - Need a total re-write of DocumentFrame, automagically doing all necessary            
      | operations and method calls to set-up a DocumentFrame with an opened file.
      | Need to have an int to keep track of open frames, openDocumentFrames.size()
      - is incorrect.  Re-think implementation of classes that are confusing.
        Beautify so I can understand it better
        Try to use XML serialization, so I can see what is happening.
        A file history menu item.
x       Remember the files that were opened. -- works sometimes
x       Open them on startup.  - works when non-null
x       May involve serialization.  - it does
X       Events may not work because source is not correct. (Listener not on correct object).
Website:

Options:
X       Do not show first time.
X       Get overwritten often.
X       If you load up the options dialog, they get saved correctly.
X       If you do not, they only save the size.
X       When you serialize the object, all information gets saved.  No matter what (yet).
TextArea:
x        Fix position bug -- not being subtracted -- does not work sometimes -- need dedicated integer
X        A pane is overlaid when you start out w/ a new pane and add a new one.
x        Add auto-indent capability. -- need to do it a different way -- editor pane does
x        not have same methods to find current place.  getCaretPosition();
Xx       Add coloring. -- need to add colors -- options are set, need to implement
Help:
        Add internal help. -- critical
X       A correct readme file.
Xx      An installer. -- doesn't have to be very sophisticated
Tools:
        Add error checker (Braces, etc) -- nice to have
